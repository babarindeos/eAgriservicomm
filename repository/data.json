University graduates can contribute solutions to societal problems that are trans-disciplinary, challenge driven and require skills beyond the knowledge of a single discipline. The role that universities play in societal development, beyond that of new knowledge creation, is gaining increased attention. How do universities address today and tomorrow\u2019s societal problems through education? How does society interact with universities and vice versa? People that enrol in university studies are often driven by a wish to make a difference in society. Universities around the world share a large pool of young, creative, curious students that want to make impact. To unleash the potential of young learners, to provide them with the skills to achieve their goals and support their entrepreneurial mind-set is a constant challenge in university education. Hence, the way we teach and train future generation is of utmost importance for both the individuals at our universities as well as for the development of our societies. Specialized knowledge will always be at the core of a university graduate\u2019s expertise. This Guide advocates that specialised knowledge be complemented by and built through open-ended, challenge based, interdisciplinary team work. Such an approach will enable students to bridge the gap between knowledge and societal demands, enabling them to make a contribution to society. Society cannot waste the talents of young people by leaving them unprepared to enter the workplace smoothly and speedily after graduation. Skills in solving open problems in teams greatly increase a graduate\u2019s employability. Problem based learning is commonly used at many universities and has developed over the years, but we prefer the word challenge driven education to underline the components of design thinking, learning creativity and the role education can play in solving societal challenges. In addition, we believe that the integration of open- ended, needs-driven problems in university education provides crucial competences for future decision-makers \u2013 for both the known and the unknown challenges ahead of us. This Guide aims to support university teachers and societal collaboration partners through providing advice and inspiration for challenge driven education. It is our hope that this Guide can serve as a platform for discussions on how to set up and realize good learning projects, leading to excellent training and development of students \u2013 as well as delivering relevant proposals for the development of solutions. Not all universities are familiar with the didactics of challenge driven learning, nor are we all comfortable in grading and assessing individual student performance in project work in teams. Society at large lacks knowledge about the potential of open-ended, team based project work. When the world need young people skilled for new complex challenges, we need to develop methods and processes that will ensure academically correct performance evaluation. Teachers engaging in project driven learning also encounter a new dimension for interaction with society and engaging with student teams requires different competencies compared to standard classroom education. It becomes the responsibility of the teacher to assure that the student groups develop into high-performance teams and to avoid team failures. The Guide will be delivered in a printed version and in a dynamic web version, this providing an opportunity to collect experiences from colleagues in different environments around the globe. It is our ambition to develop the Guide as a meeting place of universities and their teachers as well as those stakeholders that want to engage with young graduates for the benefit of societal development. This is the first published version \u2013 we still call it Work in Progress \u2013 we welcome your reflections and proposals for improvements!"}, "creation_date": "2016-04-16T07:21:03", "imprint": {"date": "2016-04-16"}, "primary_report_number": "PUBLICATIONSOTHER-2016-005", "keywords": [{"term": "KTH"}, {"term": ["Challenge-driven Education", "Societal Challenges", "Projects"]}], "physical_description": {"pagination": "90"}, "number_of_citations": 0, "title": {"title": "Guide to challenge driven education"}, "persistent_identifiers_keys": ["recid", "doi"], "email": "roberto.barbera@ct.infn.it", "files": [{"comment": null, "status": "", "magic": ["PDF document, version 1.5", "application/pdf; charset=binary", "PDF document, version 1.5", "application/pdf; charset=binary", "application/pdf"], "description": null, "url": "http://oar.sci-gaia.eu/record/174/files/PUBLICATIONSOTHER-2016-005.pdf", "eformat": ".pdf", "subformat": "", "version": 1, "full_name": "PUBLICATIONSOTHER-2016-005.pdf", "superformat": ".pdf", "path": "/opt/invenio/var/data/files/g0/315/content.pdf;1", "size": 1040632, "type": "Main", "full_path": "/opt/invenio/var/data/files/g0/315/content.pdf;1", "name": "PUBLICATIONSOTHER-2016-005"}], "collection": {"primary": "PUBLICATIONSOTHER"}, "filenames": ["PUBLICATIONSOTHER-2016-005", "PUBLICATIONSOTHER-2016-005.pdf"], "number_of_reviews": 0, "version_id": "2016-06-29T16:07:09", "FIXME_OAI": {"set": "openaire", "id": "oai:oar.sci-gaia.eu:174"}, "authors": [{"first_name": "", "last_name": "Marie Magnell", "full_name": "Marie Magnell"}, {"first_name": "", "last_name": "Anna-Karin H\u00f6gfeld", "full_name": "Anna-Karin H\u00f6gfeld"}], "doi": "10.15169/sci-gaia:1460790910.27", "number_of_authors": 2, "language": "eng", "number_of_comments": 0, "recid": 174, "filetypes": ["pdf"]},{"FIXME_CERN_internal_number": null, "comment": null, "funding_info": {"grant_number": "Sci-GaIA - Energising Scientific Endeavour through Science Gateways and e-Infrastructures in Africa"}, "added_report_number": null, "abstract": {"summary": "The video contains the Seventh Lesson of the Sci-GaIA Winter School.

Scientists have used simulation techniques to develop computer models, ranging from deterministic to stochastic models, in order to determine the resultant networks between individuals. Once a simulation has been developed, there may be challenges in how a community of practice can access the simulation and how it can be run quickly. Using distributed computing resources to run these models can help, potentially, in allowing authorised scientists to access the simulation and to increase computational power. However, the deployment and use of these resources can be extremely complex and could be quite a daunting experience, which could, in turn, prevent non-ICT experts from adopting the technology. In view of this, this paper will focus on developing a simple but intuitive user interface, known as Science Gateway (SG), for running and analysing simulation experiments for an infection model on different distributed computing infrastructures. Our demonstration infection-model has been implemented using the Recursive Porous Agent Simulation Toolkit (REPAST) Simphony. The aim of the simulation is to show how agent-based simulation can study the behaviour of infections, with an annual outbreak, by using appropriate input data with respect to illustrating how SGs can be used in this context, particularly in Euro- African collaborations. There are different SG frameworks for building and customizing SG instances, for specific scientific domain, but, in this work, the Catania Science Gateway Framework (CSGF) approach has been adopted. We will show how a SG can be used to allow multiple users, across the world, to access an agent-based simulation running on the distributed computing resources of an e- Infrastructure."}, "creation_date": "2016-04-14T23:30:56", "imprint": {"date": "2016-02-15"}, "primary_report_number": "POSTERSCIGAIA-2016-001", "keywords": [{"term": "Infection Model"}, {"term": "Agent based simulation"}, {"term": "Science Gateway"}, {"term": "E-infrastructure"}], "physical_description": {"pagination": "1"}, "number_of_citations": 0, "title": {"title": "A Science Gateway for an Agent-Based Infection Model Using REPAST"}, "persistent_identifiers_keys": ["recid", "doi"], "email": "adedeji.fabiyi@gmail.com;cspgaof@brunel.ac.uk", "files": [{"comment": null, "status": "", "magic": ["PDF document, version 1.5", "application/pdf; charset=binary", "PDF document, version 1.5", "application/pdf; charset=binary", "application/pdf"], "description": null, "url": "http://oar.sci-gaia.eu/record/170/files/POSTERSOTHERS-2016-001.pdf", "eformat": ".pdf", "subformat": "", "version": 1, "full_name": "POSTERSOTHERS-2016-001.pdf", "superformat": ".pdf", "path": "/opt/invenio/var/data/files/g0/311/content.pdf;1", "size": 634307, "type": "Main", "full_path": "/opt/invenio/var/data/files/g0/311/content.pdf;1", "name": "POSTERSOTHERS-2016-001"}], "collection": {"primary": "POSTERSCIGAIA"}, "filenames": ["POSTERSOTHERS-2016-001.pdf", "POSTERSOTHERS-2016-001"], "number_of_reviews": 0, "version_id": "2016-06-29T16:07:09", "FIXME_OAI": {"set": "openaire", "id": "oai:oar.sci-gaia.eu:170"}, "authors": [{"first_name": "", "last_name": "Adedeji Fabiyi(1)", "full_name": "Adedeji Fabiyi(1)"}, {"first_name": "", "last_name": "Simon J.E.
